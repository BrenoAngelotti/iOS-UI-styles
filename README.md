# iOS UI Styles
This is a very simple project made to display to newcomers the basic differences between different ways of coding iOS UI. 

I intend to record basic introductory videos to make iOS development more accessible to more people. But the ultimate goal is that this can work on itself to reach even more people.

## Here you will find
A basic main view from where you can navigate to views made with:
- Storyboard
- XIB
- Programmatic UIKit (aka View code)
- SwiftUI

## TO DO
- [ ] Document code, to make the project self-explanatory to newbies
- [ ] Localize, so more people can learn from it
- [ ] Tables/lists
- [ ] Forms
